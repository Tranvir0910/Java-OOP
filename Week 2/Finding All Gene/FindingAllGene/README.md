## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Algorithm in this article

1 Find first occurrence of "ATG" and call its index startIndex
2 Find the "TAA" starting from (startIndex + 3), call this result currIndex
3 As long as
  4 Check if (currIndex - startIndex) is a multiple of 3
    5 If so, the text between startIndex and currIndex + 3 is your answer
    6 If not, update currIndex to the index of the next "TAA,‚Äù starting from (curr Index + 1)

## Update Algorithm
**Method : findStopCodon (dnaStr, startIndex, stopCodon)**
- Find stopCodon starting from (startIndex + 3), call this result curr Index
- As long as curr Index is not equal to -1
  + Check if (curr Index - startIndex) is a multiple of 3
    + If so, curr Index is your answer
    + If not, update curr Index to the index of the next stopCodon, starting from (currIndex + 1)
- Your answer is dnaStr.length()

**Split into Two Problems (Abstract Out)**
1. Find first occurrence of "ATG," call its index startIndex
2. If startIndex is -1, then your answer is the empty string
3. findStopCodon (dnaStr, startIndex, "TAA") and call the result TAAindex
4. findStopCodon (dnaStr, startIndex, "TAG") and call the result TAGindex
5. findStopCodon (dnaStr, startIndex, "TGA") and call the result TGAindex
6. Take the smallest of taaIndex, tgaIndex, and tagIndex: call it min
7. If minIndex is dnaStr.length(), your answer is the empty string
8. Your answer is the text from startIndex to minIndex + 3

**Logical AND/OR**
1. Compare taaIndex and tgaIndex, choose the smaller value, and store it in minIndex.
2. Compare minIndex and tagIndex, choose the smaller value, and store it in minIndex.
3. If minIndex is still -1, return an empty string as there is no valid gene.
4. Otherwise, return the substring from StartIndex to minIndex + 3 as the valid gene.
